# Pico ST7735 Driver
Forked from: https://github.com/michal037/driver-ST7735S

## Description
I wanted a driver to use my new Pico with my cheap ST7735 based displays.  After doing some porting from WiringPi to the RP2040's C SDK's equivalents I was able to get it to work.  However, each of my displays have minor variations so I made the driver a little more customizable.

Please note, this is a rough draft and is liable to change.  

## Getting started

See [Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://rptl.io/pico-get-started) and the README in the [pico-sdk](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) for information
on getting up and running.

I've been using a Raspberry Pi setup using the official Getting Started guide and have been editing the code using VS Code with the Remote - SSH extension installed.
